### Testcase: Notification of Vehicle’s Current Position ST_001

### Preparation:
1. Launch the sf_mi node                                                                                             
2. Launch the sf_ego_localization node                                                        
3. Ensure that the webserver and the corresponding ROS2 nodes are up and running.
4. The Android device is connected to the network and can access the server's IP address.

### Test execution:
1. send a GET request to <server_ip>:8080/get_vehicle_status from the Android device.
2. Observe the response and log any errors.


### Expected result:
1. The server should return the current x-y coordinates of the vehicle in JSON format without any errors.If the position is unknown, the server should respond with a 500 status code and a relevant error message indicating that the vehicle's position is not known.

### Testcase:Notification of Vehicle Parking Status ST_002

### Preparation:
1. Launch the sf_mi node.                                                                              
2. Launch the sf_driving_controller.                                                               
3. Ensure that the webserver and the corresponding ROS2 nodes are operational.
4. The vehicle’s parking status is being updated correctly on the topic /parking_position_reached.

### Test execution:
1. Ensure the vehicle reaches a parking spot, thereby triggering an update to the /parking_position_reached topic.
2. Send a GET request to <server_ip>:8080/get_vehicle_status from the Android device to fetch the parking status.

### Expected result:
1. The server should return the parking status (true if parked, false otherwise) in JSON format along with the x-y coordinates.
If the parking status has not yet been updated, the server should still respond successfully but indicate that the parking position has not been reached.

### Expected result:
1. expected result 1
2. expected result 2

### Observations:
1. observation 1
2. observation 2
