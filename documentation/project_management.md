## Project Management

<div style="text-align: justify">
Project management is the process of organizing and leading a team to complete a project successfully. It involves setting clear goals, planning the work, assigning tasks, and making sure everything stays on track. A `Scrum Master` serves as a coach and keeps an eye on progress and makes sure the project finishes on time and a `Product Owner` prioritize tasks based on business value, communicate with stakeholders, and ensure that the team delivers features that align with the overall project goals. The goal is to deliver a final result that meets everyone's expectations.
</div>


### Tools
`Tools` and `software` were used such as  
1. `Miro` used for brainstorming.
2. `Microsoft-Teams` used for quickly meetings and also to store all the necessary files.
3. `Microsoft-ToDo` used for task distribution and set deadlines.
 
### Task distribution

<div style="text-align: justify">
It is an essential part in project management, and using "Microsoft To Do" software makes this process efficient and organized.  We used `Microsoft-ToDo` to create tasks and lists, assign tasks to team members, and set deadlines, ensuring everyone knows their responsibilities. Task distribution was based on each team member's opinion and willingness to work on different topic during the team meetings.
